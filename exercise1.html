<p class="p1">Assume an application written in Python with around six people working on it. So we have a CI setup consisting of some sort of pipeline. The setup should take care of the problem of having six different people writing code to the same code base with having the uniformity in mind. Say we use GitHub Actions. When a programmer makes a pull request to the main branch, the pipeline should check the integrity of the pull. The CI setup could use pylint to make sure the code is written in the set up standard. The module pytest should check that nothing existing feature breaks. Because we use Python in the project, there is no building step.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">It seems that there are lots of alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions. Azure has their Pipelines, there is something called Bitbucket Pipelines, Northflank, CircleCI, Gitea, the list could go on forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">For this project, cloud-based environment would be the best I think. Well, really it depends on the nature of the application we are dealing with; for an app that essentially is a web app the cloud based environment would be ideal since the deployment could be a part of the pipeline. If the testing uses heavy computing but doesn't require any scalability, a self hosted environment could work as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
